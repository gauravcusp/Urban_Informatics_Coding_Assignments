## Assignment 10

In this assignment I worked with Yu and Unisse to come up with plots and analysis. I took Unisse's help to get the dates in the array format. Apart from that I did rest of the assignment on my own with guidelines from Professor Bianco's skeleton notebooks.
Also, for Extra Credit, I took some snippets of PCA and KMeans from Professor Sobolevsky's ADS assignments.
