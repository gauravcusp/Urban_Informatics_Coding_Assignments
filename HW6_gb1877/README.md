## Assignment 6
-- By Gaurav Bhardwaj

- For this assignment, I followed the skeleton notebook shared by professor and made modifications to it. 

- I worked with Unisse and Rachel for conforming the plots we got while performing regression for polynomial. 

- I also worked with Charlie and we discussed about the results that we obtained from our models. 

- I used Professor Bianco's instructions to unzip the file in PUIDATA and extract csv file from it.
