## README for Assignment 5

### Part 1

In this assignment I generated a distribution of 100 samples and then 1000 distribution of 100 samples each. I plotted them as histograms and stored the mean of each distribution in a variable. Later I applied Z-test to the distributions and plot the Z-statistics as histigram. Then I had to check if Z-statistics follows Gaussian distribution so I applied KS test to verify that Z-statistics follows Gaussian distribution.

### Part 2

In this assignment I followed the instructions as mentioned in skeleton notebook. I worked with Rachel and Unisse to come up with the Hypothesis.

### Part 3

In this assignment I followed the instructions as per the skeleton notebook.
