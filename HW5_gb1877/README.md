## README for Assignment 5

### Part 1

In this assignment I generated a distribution of 100 samples and then 1000 distribution of 100 samples each. I plotted them as histograms and stored the mean of each distribution in a variable. Later I applied Z-test to the distributions and plot the Z-statistics as histigram. Then I had to check if Z-statistics follows Gaussian distribution so I applied KS test to verify that Z-statistics follows Gaussian distribution.

### Part 2

In this assignment I followed the instructions as mentioned in skeleton notebook. I worked with Rachel and Unisse to come up with the Hypothesis.

### Part 3

I did some enhancements on data file names for this assignment.

The data files are located at mu PUIdata directory with following names:
- Assign5_3_data.csv has data for world firearms murders and ownership
- data-pvLFI.csv has data number of mass shootings and guns per 100 inhabitants
- Population_csv.csv has world bank data for Population of each country
- GDP_csv.csv has data for GDP for each country

Alternatively, these files are also present in my HW 5 directory, HW5_gb1877

In this assignment I followed the instructions as per the skeleton notebook. I worked with Rachel to understand the logic and results behind all the plots of regression model.
