### Verification of null and alternative hypothesis

Problem Statement: Subscribers are more likely to ride their bike during the week than customers

The null hypothesis is framed well as we need to know if the subscribers during the week use more citibike than customers. The null hypothesis therefor should be something that states that subscribers use less than or rather equal to the customers of citibike. The choice of ratio of weekend to weekday use is also apt as the usage differs from weekday to weekend and we need to normalize the data to get proper statistics.

Alternative hypothesis states that the ratio of weekend to weekday subscribers is greater than the ratio of weekend to weekday customers using citibike is what we intend to achieve.
