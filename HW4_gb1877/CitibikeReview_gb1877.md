### Verification of null and alternative hypothesis

Problem Statement: Subscribers are more likely to ride their bike during the week than customers

The null hypothesis is framed well as we need to know if the subscribers during the week use more citibike than customers. The null hypothesis therefor should be something that states that subscribers use less than or rather equal to the customers of citibike. The choice of ratio of weekend to weekday use is also apt as the usage differs from weekday to weekend and we need to normalize the data to get proper statistics.

Alternative hypothesis states that the ratio of weekend to weekday subscribers is greater than the ratio of weekend to weekday customers using citibike is what we intend to achieve.

### Data verification for the problem

For analysis of the problme states above, one needs to have temporal data for subscribers and customers. Citibike offers such data where we can very well work on the aforementioned hypothesis. The hypothesis needs two varibales i.e. time and type of user which is present in the Citibike data. Also, in order to deal with the problem mathematically, Ben converted the usertype to binary values of 0 and 1.

### Appropriate test for Null hypothesis

As the problems deals with two varibales (time and user type) and one of the varibales has two categories (user type: customer and subscriber), based on the flow chart from slides, I would choose Chi square test for association. 

### Additional Comments

Based on the data, I would rather choose monthly data than weekly data. The reason being, the data for user type 'Customer' is quite small when a small time span of week is considered. The longer duration would have showed the effects of the problem in a more broader way.
