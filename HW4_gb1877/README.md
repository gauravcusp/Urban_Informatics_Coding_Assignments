## README for Assignment 4

####Assigment 1

In this assignment I forked Ben's repository and analysed his hypothesis on citi bike. I created a md file in this forked repository and added my comments to it. Later I sent pull request to merge the code with his repository.

#### Assignment 2

In this assignment I worked with Rachel and Yu to study some of the articles and get the dependent, independent and control variables.

#### Assignment 3

In this assignment I worked with Rachel and replicated steps as directed by Professor Bianco. In the later part I replicated the similar steps for other data set.

#### Assignment 4

Logistic Regression	| 1, size of community | ordinal | 1, Critical or not critical level of scalar stress| categorical | 0 | N/A | 	Do participants has a higher critical scalar level as the community size increases? | The scalar stress level will be the same or lower when there is a smaller community size| 0.05 | [Modeling Group Size and Scalar Stress by Logistic Regression from an Archaeological Perspective](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091510) |
